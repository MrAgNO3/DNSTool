# DNS Resolve Tool

DNS Resolve Tool is a command-line tool for DNS resolution, capable of performing both forward and reverse DNS lookups, and supporting various DNS query methods. The tool also allows you to save results in different file formats such as JSON, XML, CSV, and plain text.

## Key Features

- Forward DNS resolution: Query IP addresses based on hostnames.
- Reverse DNS resolution: Query hostnames based on IP addresses.
- Supports multiple DNS query methods: including `nslookup`, `dig`, `host`, and `socket`.
- Allows custom DNS server specification.
- Formatted result output: Supports JSON, XML, CSV, and plain text formats.
- Cross-platform support: Runs on both Windows and Linux operating systems.

## Usage

### Install Dependencies

This tool requires `Python 3.3` or higher. Please ensure that you have a compatible version of Python installed on your system. 

If you got the right version, you do not need to install any additional libraries.

### Command-line Options

```bash
usage: DNSTool.py [-h] [-r] -i INPUT [-o OUTPUT] [-f {nslookup,host,dig,socket}] [-s SERVER]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r, --reverse         Reverse DNS resolution, or default ro forward resolution
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        Input ip/host list file
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        default result.json
  -f {nslookup,host,dig,socket}, --function {nslookup,host,dig,socket}
                        which function to use, default dig
  -s SERVER, --server SERVER
                        DNSServer
```

### Example Usage

1. Forward DNS resolution:
```bash
python dns_resolve.py -i hosts.txt -o results.json -f dig -s 8.8.8.8 
```

2. Reverse DNS resolution:
```bash
python dns_resolve.py -r -i ips.txt -o results.xml -f nslookup -s 8.8.8.8
```
## Output Formats

- JSON format example:

```json 
{
    "1.1.1.1": [
        "one.one.one.one"
    ],
    "8.8.8.8": [
        "dns.google"
    ],
    "123.123.123.132": []
}
```

- XML format example:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<data>
	<ip address="1.1.1.1">
		<hostname>one.one.one.one</hostname>
	</ip>
	<ip address="8.8.8.8">
		<hostname>dns.google</hostname>
	</ip>
	<ip address="123.123.123.132"/>
</data>
```

- CSV format example:

```csv 
IP Address,Hostnames 
93.184.216.34,example.com 
172.217.168.174,google.com 
192.0.66.2,openai.org
```
- Plain text format example:
```
example.com: 93.184.216.34
google.com: 172.217.168.174
openai.org: 192.0.66.2, 192.0.66.128 
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the required dependencies are installed on your system (see the "Install Dependencies" section).
- When performing reverse DNS resolution, provide an input file containing a list of IP addresses.
- By default, the output file will be saved in JSON format. If you need a different format, use the `-o` option to specify the output file name and format.
